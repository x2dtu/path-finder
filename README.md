# Path Finder Visualization
This is a personal project I created intended to learn more about various pathfinding algorithms by seeing their strengths and weaknesses in different types of mazes. This project was created using python pygame and visualizes depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* pathfinding in user-created mazes and pathfinding scenarios. Please email me at 3069391@gmail.com or comment on this project page should you have any questions about the visualizer, suggestions for further improvement, or have found any bugs.
